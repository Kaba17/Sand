We need to STOP UI-only work and build a WORKING PLATFORM foundation.

Project: Sanad (سند)
Scope: Flight Claims ONLY

Current State:
- UI prototype exists
- Some AI/OCR ideas exist
- BUT there is NO real backend, no admin dashboard, no auth
- App is NOT operational

GOAL OF THIS TASK:
Make Sanad a FUNCTIONAL application where:
- A user can submit a flight claim
- An admin can log in
- Admin can see/manage claims
- Claim has a lifecycle and is stored in DB
- Everything works end-to-end BEFORE adding more AI/OCR

================================
PHASE 1 — BACKEND (MANDATORY)
================================
Build a real backend using Node.js + Express (or Fastify).

Create API endpoints:

PUBLIC:
POST /api/claims
- Create a new flight claim
- Required fields:
  airline, flightNumber, flightDate, fromAirport, toAirport,
  disruptionType (delay/cancel/etc),
  delayMinutes (optional),
  userName, userEmail, userPhone
- Generate claimId + trackingCode
- Save to database
- Create initial timeline event: "Claim created"

GET /api/claims/track
- Input: trackingCode + email/phone
- Return: claim summary + status + timeline

ADMIN (protected):
GET /api/admin/claims
GET /api/admin/claims/:id
PATCH /api/admin/claims/:id/status
POST /api/admin/claims/:id/note
POST /api/admin/claims/:id/submit   // mark claim as submitted to airline

================================
PHASE 2 — DATABASE
================================
Use SQLite or existing DB setup.

Tables (minimum):

users:
- id
- email
- password_hash
- role (admin)

claims:
- id
- tracking_code
- airline
- flight_number
- flight_date
- from_airport
- to_airport
- disruption_type
- delay_minutes
- user_name
- user_email
- user_phone
- status (new, reviewing, submitted, waiting_response, closed)
- created_at

timeline:
- id
- claim_id
- event
- created_at

================================
PHASE 3 — AUTHENTICATION
================================
- Implement simple admin login (email + password)
- Session or JWT is fine
- Protect all /api/admin/* routes
- NO public admin access

================================
PHASE 4 — ADMIN DASHBOARD (REAL, NOT MOCK)
================================
Create a working Admin UI:

/admin/login
- Login form

/admin
- Table of claims:
  Claim ID | Airline | Flight Date | Status | Created At

/admin/claims/:id
- Claim details
- Timeline
- Change status
- Add internal note
- Button: "Mark as Submitted"

================================
IMPORTANT RULES
================================
- NO AI
- NO OCR
- NO Claude
- NO flight status APIs
- NO extra features

Focus ONLY on:
- Backend
- Database
- Auth
- Admin dashboard
- End-to-end working flow

================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================
I should be able to:
1) Submit a flight claim
2) Log in as admin
3) See the claim in admin dashboard
4) Update its status
5) See timeline update correctly

Once this works, we will move to AI phase.
